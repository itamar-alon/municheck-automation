An advanced **End-to-End (E2E)** test automation framework designed to validate critical digital services for the Rishon LeZion Municipality. The framework simulates real user journeys across multiple modules (Water, Education, Parking, Business Licensing, etc.) to ensure system stability and link integrity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Built with a scalable architecture that strictly separates test logic (`tests/`) from page interaction logic (`pages/`), ensuring high maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization (Smart Verify)**: Implemented a "Smart Link Verification" mechanism. Instead of the slow "Click & Wait" approach, the framework performs static DOM analysis (href validation).
  - **Result**: Reduced "Water Interface" test execution time by **~80%** (from 6 minutes to ~1 minute).
- **Robust Error Handling**: Automatic screenshot capture upon test failure, saving artifacts with timestamps for rapid debugging.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Full integration with Allure Framework to generate detailed, interactive HTML reports with step-by-step execution logs.
- **Secure Configuration**: Sensitive data (credentials, URLs) is managed via an external `.env` file, keeping the codebase secure and Git-clean.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Web Driver**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Test Runner**: Pytest
- **Reporting**: Allure Report
- **Configuration Management**: `python-dotenv`
